## BLISS analysis

Currently there are two main paths:
1. DSB counting per regions

  Including:
  - fractions in intergenic, genebody, TSS +/-2.5kb, intron and exon regions
  - fragile genes and TSS, ie. genes that has the most DSBs (topX%)
  
2. Chromosome-wide plotting of DSBs

  Including:
  - plotting DSBs along the genome with karyogram
  
  _Will include:_
  _- circos plotting of DSBs_
  
3. Enrichment analysis

  Including:
  - DSB visualisation in the gene body region
  - DSB counting in highly expressed genes
  
  _Will include:_
  _- DSB visualisation around recurrent rearrangement breakpoints_
