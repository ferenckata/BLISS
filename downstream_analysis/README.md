### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## BLISS analysis

Each folder contains a README file, that either contains the description of the codes or the description of the required pre-analysis steps in the terminal, and the source codes of the corresponding function in the R package.

Currently there are two main paths:
1. DSB counting per regions
  - fractions in intergenic, genebody, TSS +/-2.5kb, intron and exon regions
  - fragile genes and TSS, ie. genes that has the most DSBs (topX%)
  
2. Chromosome-wide plotting of DSBs
  - plotting DSBs along the genome with karyogram
  
  _Will include: circos plotting of DSBs_
  
3. Enrichment analysis
  - DSB visualisation in the gene body region
  - DSB counting in highly expressed genes
  
  _Will include: DSB visualisation around recurrent rearrangement breakpoints_
