# ------------------- third part: plotting ----------------------

# From this point R is used, because itâ€™s good for managing data frames and plotting.
# DSBs are counted in these exonic regions. DSB number in intron is calculated as [(DSB# in gene) - (DSB# in exon)].
# DSB number in intergenic region is calculated as [(total # DSB) - (DSB# in gene)].
# the corresponding codes are described in the README
