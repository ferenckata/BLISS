### 1. Download TCGA dataset

My latest information (04.05.2018) is to download from here: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/

### 2. Copy number variation

The open datasets are based on SNPs and already segmented. It means that the breakpoints are rather "breakregions" with the length of approx 1-10kb between consecutive regions with diffrent copy numbers.
For comparison, the resolution of the DSB distribution should be also in this range.
